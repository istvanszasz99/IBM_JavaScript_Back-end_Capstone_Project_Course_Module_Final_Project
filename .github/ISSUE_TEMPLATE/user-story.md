**As a** back-end developer
**I need** to build a RESTful API for the IBM Capstone Project
**So that** it can efficiently handle data operations, interact with the database, and serve client applications reliably.

### Details and Assumptions
- The backend will be developed using Node.js and Express.js
- Data will be stored in a database (MongoDB)
- The API should follow RESTful principles
- Endpoints will include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- JWT authentication will be implemented for secure access
- Error handling and input validation will be enforced
- Documentation will be provided

### Acceptance Criteria
    Given the API server is running  
    When an HTTP request is made with an API to an endpoint  
    Then the server responds with a the correct status code
